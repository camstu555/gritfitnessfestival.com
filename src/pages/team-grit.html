            <h2>TEAM GRIT has multiple divisions in order to give everyone an opportunity to test their fitness. 
            This wide selection accomodates all fitness levels, from the seasoned vet to the beginner athlete 
            and everything inbetween. Below you will find a description for each division.</h2>

<br>            
            <h2>The workouts are designed to test a teams ability to work together in various combinations. 
            Teams will have to develop a strategy on how to best utilize each team member throughout the 
            day. A teams performance may get tested with Power and/or Olympic Lifting, Endurance, Gymnastics, 
            Plyometrics and other uncommon tasks. These movements will be programmed in a variety of ways and 
            teams will compete against each other to determine who is the BEST TEAM!!</h2>
